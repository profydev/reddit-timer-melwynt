## About This Project

I implemented this project in the context of a course at [profy.dev](https://profy.dev/). This course mimics a professional real-world development environment.

Designs were provided via [Figma](https://figma.com/). The project was split into small tasks using [Clickup](https://clickup.com/) as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed line by line by [Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/about/), a senior developer.

In this project I have been exposed to many practical techniques that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Examples as following but not limited to:

- **Creating pixel-perfect designs**
- **Planning and implementing a complex UI component**
- **Implement data fetching with error handling**
- **Debugging inside an IDE**
- **Writing integration tests**
- **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
- **Code reviews**
- **Continuous integration**

I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of a given task. The only limitation was to use React.

The code reviews gave me insights into best practices to follow (see [this example](https://github.com/profydev/reddit-timer-melwynt/pull/14#pullrequestreview-1026887053)). I was able to learn a lot and evolve my front-end knowledge rapidly.
